# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

![logo](https://github.com/Abdul-Jaweed/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/blob/main/logo.png)

This repository is a collection of my journey to learn Data Structures and Algorithms using C++. I've dedicated 180 days to this learning process, and I'll be sharing my progress, code implementations, and useful resources throughout this journey.

## About

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that play a crucial role in solving complex problems efficiently. In this repository, I'll be documenting my learning process and sharing my C++ implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

## Goals

My main goals for this 180-day journey include:

- Learning core data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- Understanding essential algorithms like sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.
- Solving a wide range of coding challenges and problems.
- Building practical applications to apply what I've learned.

## Project Structure {Updated soon}

The project is organized into different directories, each focusing on specific topics. Here's an overview:

- **`data-structures/`**: Contains implementations of various data structures.
- **`algorithms/`**: Houses different algorithms and their implementations.
- **`challenges/`**: Includes solutions to coding challenges and problems.
- **`applications/`**: Real-world applications that apply DSA concepts.

Feel free to explore these directories to see my progress and code implementations.

## Learning Resources

During my journey, I'm using a variety of learning resources, including:

- Primary Resource [Coder Army](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQEaRBV9gAFu4ovJ41PywklqI7IyXwr01&si=9VBRF9RrW8Qmfxux) YouTube Channel
- Coding platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces
- Blogs and articles

I'll be updating this section with links to the resources I find most helpful.

## Progress

I'm keeping track of my daily progress in a dedicated [Progress Log](progress.md) file. You can see my daily updates, challenges I've tackled, and milestones achieved.
